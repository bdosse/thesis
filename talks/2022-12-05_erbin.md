## Fourier transform
A Fourier transform is used for stochastic processes, but never defined. One 
may find valuable informations in Ayache's book (see References), p.12-14.

## Brownian sheet & Brownian field
A Brownian sheet is defined by mean of the tensor product of covariances, 
whereas a brownian field is defined by means of a norm on the euclidean space.
The paper use harmonizable representation to study the (HÃ¶lder) regularity of 
their sample paths.

## Regularity
Should investigate in the direction of the "Hurst exponent function" from 
Ayache's book.
